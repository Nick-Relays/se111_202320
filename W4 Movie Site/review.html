                <p>In my opinon Bad Boys II is a very good movie becuase the actor choice was very good and Micheal Bay is very good a directing action movies and the chase secnes and any actions were well thought out and very well executed in the movie.  </p>

                    <h3><em>Bad Boys II</em>Trivia</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Mike uses the same line near the end of both movies with just a little change. First, "that's how you're supposed to drive, from now on, that's how you drive!" Second "that's how you're supposed to shoot, from now on, that's how you shoot!"</li>
                        
                        <li>During the freeway chase scene, Michael Bay attached cameras to a couple of stunt cars, and asked the drivers to crash into the falling cars, in order to capture never-before-seen shots</li>
                        
                        <li>Johnny Tapia's Miami mansion is actually an enormous estate known as "Vizcaya". It was built by industrialist James Deering in the early twentieth century as his "winter home". The estate is now a public museum and its gardens are a popular spot for weddings.</li>
